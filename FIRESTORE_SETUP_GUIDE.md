# 🔥 Firestore Database Setup Guide

## Current Status

✅ Firebase configuration updated with your project details
✅ Firebase SDK properly imported and configured
✅ Test Firebase button added to Data Entry form

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Set Up Firestore Database

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `coal-mine-breakdown-management`
3. Click **"Firestore Database"** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"Create database"**
5. Choose **"Start in test mode"** (allows read/write for 30 days)
6. Select your preferred region (choose closest to your location)
7. Click **"Done"**

### 2. Configure Security Rules

After creating the database:

1. In Firestore Database, click the **"Rules"** tab
2. Replace the default rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read and write access to breakdownRecords collection
    match /breakdownRecords/{document} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click **"Publish"**

### 3. Test the Connection

1. In your React app, click the **"🔥 Test Firebase"** button
2. Check the browser console for detailed logs
3. Expected results:
   - ✅ Success: "Firebase connected successfully. Found X records."
   - ❌ Error: Specific error message with troubleshooting steps

### 4. Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "Permission denied"

**Solution:** Check Firestore security rules are published correctly

#### Issue: "Firebase connection timeout"

**Solution:** Verify your internet connection and Firebase project status

#### Issue: "Collection doesn't exist"

**Solution:** This is normal for new projects - collection will be created when you add first record

### 5. Verify Everything Works

1. **Test Firebase Connection**: Click "🔥 Test Firebase" button
2. **Submit a Record**: Fill out the form and click "Submit Breakdown Report"
3. **Check Records Tab**: Should show your submitted data
4. **Check Firebase Console**: Go to Firestore Database → Data tab to see stored records

## Expected Database Structure

Your records will be stored like this:

```
breakdownRecords (collection)
├── [auto-generated-id-1] (document)
│   ├── date: "2025-06-25"
│   ├── executive: "Yeshwanth"
│   ├── shift: "General (8am-5pm)"
│   ├── machine: "SDL"
│   ├── category: "Electrical"
│   ├── description: "Motor failure"
│   ├── delayTime: 2.5
│   ├── priority: "High"
│   ├── spareParts: "Motor bearings"
│   ├── resolution: "Replaced bearings"
│   ├── timestamp: [server timestamp]
│   └── createdAt: "2025-06-25T10:30:00.000Z"
```
